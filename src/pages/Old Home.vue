        Hi there! I'm Keiryan Wilson, a passionate and innovative Front-End
        Developer dedicated to transforming complex ideas into elegant,
        user-friendly digital experiences. With a wealth of experience working
        on high-impact projects, I specialize in creating visually engaging and
        accessible web applications that not only meet but exceed client
        expectations.

        Over the years, I've had the privilege of leading front-end development
        for Fortune 500 companies, crafting responsive, ADA-compliant designs,
        and modernizing legacy systems with cutting-edge technologies like
        React, Next.js, and Docker. My work is driven by a commitment to
        inclusivity and usability, ensuring that every user can enjoy a seamless
        and engaging experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not just a coder; I'm a collaborator, mentor, and problem-solver.
        From my time at Apple, where I honed my skills in customer engagement
        and technical support, to my role as a Lead Developer at Thatcher Tech,
        I've always prioritized clear communication, teamwork, and continuous
        learning. Explore my portfolio to see how I can bring your digital
        vision to life with scalable, high-performance web applications. Let's
